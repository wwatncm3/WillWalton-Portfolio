## Software Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find highlights from my work in software engineering, including projects in cloud computing, backend systems, and user-focused applications. Each project includes an overview, the tools I used, and my role in making it happen.

> **Note:** Some of my best work was done during internships, so I can't share the actual code due to confidentiality. Instead, I've included detailed project descriptions to give you a clear picture of what I worked on, the goals, and the impact each project made.
