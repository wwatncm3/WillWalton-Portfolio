# Integration Monitoring System & Logging Framework
*Data Engineering Internship Project*

## Project Overview
During my internship with a major energy corporation, I developed a monitoring dashboard using Power BI to track integration activities across cloud resources. The project included implementing a structured logging framework that improved how teams track and troubleshoot integration processes.

## Key Features

### Integration Activity Monitoring
- Built visualizations for monitoring key cloud services and their execution metrics
- Created easy-to-use interfaces for accessing resource details and performance data
- Implemented performance tracking to help teams quickly identify potential issues

### Service Queue Monitoring
- Developed real-time monitoring for message traffic and queue health
- Created custom visualizations to track:
  - Active message status
  - Message delivery metrics
  - Queue performance indicators
- Enabled teams to proactively identify and address potential bottlenecks

### User Experience Improvements
- Added date range filtering for flexible time period analysis
- Implemented data refresh indicators
- Designed intuitive navigation paths to relevant resources

## Logging Framework Development

### Standardized Logging Structure
- Designed a comprehensive logging system with multiple severity levels
- Implemented consistent logging patterns including:
  - Standard timestamps
  - Event categorization
  - Resource identifiers
  - Contextual information

### Error Management
- Created robust error logging with relevant contextual details
- Set up monitoring alerts for critical issues
- Developed standard response protocols

## Testing Implementation
- Wrote automated tests to validate integration flows
- Created test scenarios for:
  - Various failure conditions
  - Performance thresholds
  - System recovery processes
- Performed thorough end-to-end testing

## Business Impact

### For Engineers
- Reduced troubleshooting time
- Improved system reliability tracking

### For Analysts
- Enhanced data visibility
- Better performance tracking capabilities

### For Project Management
- Improved process monitoring
- Enhanced delivery tracking
- Better sprint management visibility

## Technology Stack
